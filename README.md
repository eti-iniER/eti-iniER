# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Eti-ini (_ey-tea-knee_)
I'm a third-year Computer Science major at the University of Lagos, Nigeria. You'll find me building cool stuff on the Web, or participating in Codeforces contests ;)

This is my GitHub page, so feel free to check out my repositories and projects. You can also email me at [etinieffiongrobert@gmail.com](mailto:etinieffiongrobert@gmail.com)
