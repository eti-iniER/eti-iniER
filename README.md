# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Eti-ini (_ey-tea-knee_)
I'm a software developer, writer and CS student currently living/working in Lagos, Nigeria. I'm still just a beginner (aren't we all?) but I'm familiar with a few programming languages and frameworks. These include:  
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* C++
* Django
* React
* Bootstrap
* Git/GitHub

I'm passionate about tech, and I'm using GitHub mainly as a store for all my ideas and dreams. If you'd like to see what I come up with, follow me!
