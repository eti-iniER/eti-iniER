# 👋 Hi, I’m Eti-ini (*ey-tea-knee*)

I’m a CS student and software engineer currently based in Lagos, Nigeria 🇳🇬
I like building full-stack applications, thinking too hard about system design, and occasionally stress-testing my brain on Leetcode and Codeforces.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **backend systems**, **modern web apps**, and **generative AI**. Currently open to freelance contracts, summer internships, and part-time SWE roles in Nigeria and Canada.

### What I’m usually doing

* Building full-stack web apps (React, Django, FastAPI, Remix)
* Shipping freelance and contract work for real users
* Competing in programming contests when I want to feel intellectually humbled 😄

### Tech I reach for
Python, Go, TypeScript, React, Django, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, AWS
(plus testing, CI/CD, and all the boring but important glue)
